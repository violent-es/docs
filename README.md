# VioletScript Standard

- The proper VioletScript spec has not been written. What is in the `spec` directory may be incomplete. Some of the semantics are explained in the VioletScript user documentation and also in the compiler infrastructure itself.
- The `builtins` directory is incomplete and would provide sources for the built-in standard objects.

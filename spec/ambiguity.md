# Ambiguity

## Syntactic desambiguation

- Typed identifier is allowed as an expression. There are however syntactic contexts where it is not allowed:
  - As an alternative expression of a conditional expression.
  - As a test expression for switch statement `case`.
  - As an expression statement's initial expression, where a labeled statement takes place.
